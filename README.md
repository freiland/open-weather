#### By _Forrest Reiland and Sean Wilson_

## Description 

_This application allows a user to input a city, state, and country, and then receive up-to-date information about the locations weather. This application uses an API from openweather.org to interface current weather conditions. An API, or application proccess interface is a sensitive and personal piece of information and is not included in this application. To create your own API go to openweathermap.org. Create your account, following the steps listed in the signup option in the upper right. After you have created your account, view MyServices. There will be a tab that says API Keys, here you can name and generate your custom API Key. That API key should then be stored in a .env folder within your project directory. The API should never be pushed to GitHub or shared._
